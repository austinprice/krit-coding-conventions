# Sass Guidelines
A set of conventions for writing clean, organized and scalable Sass.

## Architecture
A clean and organized folder structure is key. To keep our Sass folder structure organized, we make use of partials and a modified version of the 7-1 Pattern of structuring folders, with 6 folders and 1 index file. The folders are:

- /base
- /components
- /layout
- /pages
- /abstracts
- /vendors
- index.scss
